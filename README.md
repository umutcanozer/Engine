# Custom C++ Game Engine 

This project is a custom game engine built from scratch using **C++** and **DirectX 11**, designed with a modern **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture.

## Features Implemented (So far)
- Real-time rendering pipeline (DirectX 11)
- Entity-Component-System architecture (using `entt`)
- Constant buffer system and transform support
- Basic model loading (.obj)
- Camera system (position, rotation, projection, controller)

## Coming Soon
- ImGui-based scene editor
- Lighting & basic shadows
- Skybox rendering
- Physics integration
- Scripting layer

## Tech Stack
- C++20
- DirectX 11
- EnTT
- Assimp 
- ImGui 

## Note
This project is still in active development. Feel free to follow the progress or contribute by giving feedback and ideas!
